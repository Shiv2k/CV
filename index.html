    I have completed my Intermediate from <a href="http://www.sunvalleyncr.in/"><b>Sun valley Public School.</b></a>  affiliated to CBSE.<br />

      I was too picky as to what I was even taking a look at. I was essentially reading what my mind was conditioned
      to, 100% of the time.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Than, today, I decided to do the exact opposite. I took my reading list, which, of course, consists only of
        topics I’m interested in, and I’ve just fu**king read the articles, one by one,<br /> in order, actually paying
        attention to them and looking up for things I didn’t know about.
      </li>
      <li>
        The result was obvious. There’s so much more to learn when you’re actually there and you’re not constrained
         to what your brain finds interesting just by looking at the title.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      When I was reading, I wasn’t actually there. I was basically skimming through or going directly from the title
      to the comments, without paying much attention.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I consider myself a reasonably successful Software Engineer / Architect and I decided to share with you the
      attitude and behavior that contributed the most in my career development. Instead of writing a “listicle”
      (I hate this name :)), I decided to tell a little bit about my story and the lessons I’ve learned along the way.
    </li>
    <li>
      I started my professional career at age 21, 11 years ago. I was extremely excited to finally be a developer.
       I felt like I was being paid to do what I’d do for free, if I hadn’t bills to pay.
